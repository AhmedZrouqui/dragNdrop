# Drag and Drop test project

This application has been created with vite + React `yarn create vite`

## Installation

Just run `yarn install` or `npm install` and you're ready to go.

`npm run dev` to launch application. (`--host` is already implemented, for network exposure).

## What's done:

# [x] Use React to create the application
# [x] Use any third-party library for drag-and-drop functionality (e.g., react-dnd)
# [x] The application must be responsive
# [x] The application should be designed using modern UI/UX principles
# [x] Use a modern CSS pre-processor (e.g., SASS, LESS)
# [x] Use modern JavaScript syntax and ES6 features
# [x] Use a linter (e.g., ESLint) and adhere to best practices and code quality standards
# [x] Create a GitHub repository and share the link with us when you're done
# [x] Use TypeScript instead of JavaScript
# [x] Use modern CSS frameworks (e.g., MUI, TailwindCSS, Bulma, Bootstrap 5) to enhance the UI and reduce the amount of custom CSS needed
# [] Implement automated tests for the application (e.g., Jest, Enzyme, React Testing
