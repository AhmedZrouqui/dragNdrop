# Drag and Drop Test Project ðŸš€

## [Live Preview](https://feat-addpreviewimage--scintillating-parfait-66f416.netlify.app/)


This application has been created with vite + React `yarn create vite`

## Installation 

Just run `yarn install` or `npm install` and you're ready to go.

`npm run dev` to launch application. (`--host` is already implemented, for network exposure).

## Design ðŸŽ¨

I have made a minimal UI Design on Figma, accessible via this [Link](https://www.figma.com/file/sUHnXCQlkymi132bZVVhXD/Drag-N-Drop-UI?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design)

Sneak peek ðŸ‘€:

## Note ðŸ‘‹

I have used [@use-gesture](https://use-gesture.netlify.app/) to build the drap and drop behavior. this library doesn't come with the whole pack included, but I got to do my own logic for the drop and drag of elements.

I also used [react-spring](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-spring) to make some cool draging effects.

## What's done:

- âœ… Use React to create the application
- âœ… Use any third-party library for drag-and-drop functionality (e.g., react-dnd)
- âœ… The application must be responsive
- âœ… The application should be designed using modern UI/UX principles
- âœ… Use a modern CSS pre-processor (e.g., SASS, LESS)
- âœ… Use modern JavaScript syntax and ES6 features
- âœ… Use a linter (e.g., ESLint) and adhere to best practices and code quality standards
- âœ… Create a GitHub repository and share the link with us when you're done
- âœ… Use TypeScript instead of JavaScript
- âœ… Use modern CSS frameworks (e.g., MUI, TailwindCSS, Bulma, Bootstrap 5) to enhance the UI and reduce the amount of custom CSS needed
- â­• Implement automated tests for the application (e.g., Jest, Enzyme, React Testing
Library)
