# Drag and Drop test project

## [Live Preview](https://feat-addpreviewimage--scintillating-parfait-66f416.netlify.app/)

This application has been created with vite + React `yarn create vite`

## Installation

Just run `yarn install` or `npm install` and you're ready to go.

`npm run dev` to launch application. (`--host` is already implemented, for network exposure).

## Design

I have made a minimal UI Design on Figma, accessible via this [Link](https://www.figma.com/file/sUHnXCQlkymi132bZVVhXD/Drag-N-Drop-UI?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design)

## Note

I have used [@use-gesture](https://use-gesture.netlify.app/) to build the drap and drop behavior. this library doesn't come with the whole pack included, but I got to do my own logic for the drop and drag of elements.

I also used [react-spring](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-spring) to make some cool draging effects.

## What's done:

- [x] Use React to create the application
- [x] Use any third-party library for drag-and-drop functionality (e.g., react-dnd)
- [x] The application must be responsive
- [x] The application should be designed using modern UI/UX principles
- [x] Use a modern CSS pre-processor (e.g., SASS, LESS)
- [x] Use modern JavaScript syntax and ES6 features
- [x] Use a linter (e.g., ESLint) and adhere to best practices and code quality standards
- [x] Create a GitHub repository and share the link with us when you're done
- [x] Use TypeScript instead of JavaScript
- [x] Use modern CSS frameworks (e.g., MUI, TailwindCSS, Bulma, Bootstrap 5) to enhance the UI and reduce the amount of custom CSS needed
- [ ] Implement automated tests for the application (e.g., Jest, Enzyme, React Testing
Library)
